The aim of this project was to enable data-driven decision making to enhance patient safety and quality of care.\n\nThe biggest challenge of this project was to make ML models easy to interact with for end users who lacked data science experience. To address this challenge, I collaborated with the team to design and develop user-friendly interfaces that allowed risk and feedback managers to easily access and analyze ML-generated insights. I also provided training and support to help end users understand the capabilities and limitations of ML models and interpret the results.\n\nOverall, the IRAP Project was a high-impact research initiative that demonstrated my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to address complex healthcare challenges. My contribution to the project showcased my expertise in designing and developing user-friendly interfaces and my dedication to ensuring that end users can fully benefit from advanced technologies.\n\n","process":"","persona":"","learn":"","takeaway":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
