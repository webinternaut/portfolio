This was a critical project that aimed to modernize a paper-based process by introducing digital submissions. One of the biggest challenges was to cater to a user base who were not tech-savvy.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, I drew inspiration from my own family, especially my mother, who fit the persona of our users: female, 45+, and non tech-savvy. As my family's go-to person for all things tech, I observed what sparked my mother's interest in using technology. One key observation was that she loved interacting with big icons on her phone. Based on this insight, I created the Icon Wall, a collection of big icons that served as an engagement point for all our products within our suite of products. The Icon Wall became our biggest marketing feature and was prominently featured throughout our marketing materials.\n\nDespite the limited resources at a company with under 50 employees, I was able to lead this project to a successful launch. This project was one of my biggest and most impactful designs, and it demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative solutions that cater to the needs of diverse user groups.","process":"","persona":"","learn":"","takeaway":""}},"__N_SSG":true}
