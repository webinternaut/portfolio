              "section1": "As the team lead member of the IRAP Project, a research initiative funded by the Canadian government, I was responsible for bringing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to risk and feedback managers in healthcare facilities. The aim of this project was to enable data-driven decision making to enhance patient safety and quality of care.\n\nThe biggest challenge of this project was to make ML models easy to interact with for end users who lacked data science experience. To address this challenge, I collaborated with the team to design and develop user-friendly interfaces that allowed risk and feedback managers to easily access and analyze ML-generated insights. I also provided training and support to help end users understand the capabilities and limitations of ML models and interpret the results.\n\nOverall, the IRAP Project was a high-impact research initiative that demonstrated my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to address complex healthcare challenges. My contribution to the project showcased my expertise in designing and developing user-friendly interfaces and my dedication to ensuring that end users can fully benefit from advanced technologies.\n\n",

            "section1": "In the early days as the sole frontend developer and designer at RLSolutions, I led the product design of our healthcare solution for hospital Adverse events. This was a critical project that aimed to modernize a paper-based process by introducing digital submissions. One of the biggest challenges was to cater to a user base who were not tech-savvy.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, I drew inspiration from my own family, especially my mother, who fit the persona of our users: female, 45+, and non tech-savvy. As my family's go-to person for all things tech, I observed what sparked my mother's interest in using technology. One key observation was that she loved interacting with big icons on her phone. Based on this insight, I created the Icon Wall, a collection of big icons that served as an engagement point for all our products within our suite of products. The Icon Wall became our biggest marketing feature and was prominently featured throughout our marketing materials.\n\nDespite the limited resources at a company with under 50 employees, I was able to lead this project to a successful launch. This project was one of my biggest and most impactful designs, and it demonstrated my ability to deliver innovative solutions that cater to the needs of diverse user groups.",
