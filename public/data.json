              "section1": "As the team lead member of the IRAP Project, a research initiative funded by the Canadian government, I was responsible for bringing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to risk and feedback managers in healthcare facilities. The aim of this project was to enable data-driven decision making to enhance patient safety and quality of care.\n\nThe biggest challenge of this project was to make ML models easy to interact with for end users who lacked data science experience. To address this challenge, I collaborated with the team to design and develop user-friendly interfaces that allowed risk and feedback managers to easily access and analyze ML-generated insights. I also provided training and support to help end users understand the capabilities and limitations of ML models and interpret the results.\n\nOverall, the IRAP Project was a high-impact research initiative that demonstrated my ability to leverage cutting-edge technologies to address complex healthcare challenges. My contribution to the project showcased my expertise in designing and developing user-friendly interfaces and my dedication to ensuring that end users can fully benefit from advanced technologies.\n\n",

            "section1": "As the sole designer and frontend developer, I was tasked with upgrading our current product suite from a desktop application to a web application. With limited design and UX resources, I knew that I would have to compromise on user testing and instead rely on user research to guide my design decisions.\n\nTo conduct user research, I enlisted the help of other teams within the company, including Client Services & Sales. They helped distribute questionnaires and fill in user profile checklists when they were on site or on the phone with clients. Utilizing lean UX methodology, I asked clients about what applications they typically used at work and home, which gave us valuable insights that informed the design and workflows of our application.\n\nOne of the most important findings from our surveys was that current clients preferred using paper over electronic submissions. To find a solution for engaging our users, I turned to an unsuspecting user â€“ my mom. She fit the same persona as our users, and I noticed how confident and engaged she was with the icons on the home page of her phone. This inspired the creation of the RL6 Icon Wall, which became a standard feature in hospitals for Risk and Feedback Managers.\n\nWe went through many iterations of design and conducted A/B testing to guide us, and we ultimately decided to develop the icon wall using plain HTML and CSS2 due to our users' outdated computers and security restrictions.\n\nThe release of the icon wall was a UX success, with user engagement increasing by over 500%. It became a point of pride for our marketing materials and our number one user feature, and it was exclusively endorsed by the AHA for nearly 10 years.\n\n ## Takeaways \n\n This project taught me the importance of wearing many hats to succeed and the power of cross-departmental collaboration when resources are limited. Utilizing lean UX allowed us to focus on the bigger problems while setting up the application's design base to come back to later, and technical understanding of frontend and client needs was crucial in supporting our end users' needs.",
